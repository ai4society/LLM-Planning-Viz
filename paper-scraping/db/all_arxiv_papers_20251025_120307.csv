purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20258v1,"cs.AI, I.2"

requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs
can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities
cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to
integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and
motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate
LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16
algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our
zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the
Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times
than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details
increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL
descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower)
reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to
correct its mistakes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00182v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI"

Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), designed to advance foundational
symbolic reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates
problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order
logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation
solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality
problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous
difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel
training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm
the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising
resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18083v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"

capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12987v1,cs.AI

diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning
remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a
novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs'
symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our
approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action
applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical
inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through
the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied
in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes
through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification
skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about
precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation.
Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our
chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly
better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard
benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This
work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the
logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising
direction for developing better AI planning systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13351v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10054v1,XAgents: A Unified Framework for Multi-Agent Cooperation via IF-THEN Rules and Multipolar Task Processing Graph,"Hailong Yang, Mingxian Gu, Jianqi Wang, Guanjin Wang, Zhaohong Deng",2025-09-12,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in supporting humans
with complex, real-world tasks. However, MAS still face challenges in effective
task planning when handling highly complex tasks with uncertainty, often
resulting in misleading or incorrect outputs that hinder task execution. To
address this, we propose XAgents, a unified multi-agent cooperative framework
built on a multipolar task processing graph and IF-THEN rules. XAgents uses the
multipolar task processing graph to enable dynamic task planning and handle
task uncertainty. During subtask processing, it integrates domain-specific
IF-THEN rules to constrain agent behaviors, while global rules enhance
inter-agent collaboration. We evaluate the performance of XAgents across three
distinct datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches in both
knowledge-typed and logic-typed question-answering tasks. The codes for XAgents

http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08222v1,Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning For Continual Embodied Instruction Following,"Minjong Yoo, Jinwoo Jang, Wei-jin Park, Honguk Woo",2025-09-10,"This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08222v1,cs.AI
http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13876v1,Improved Generalized Planning with LLMs through Strategy Refinement and Reflection,"Katharina Stein, Nils Hodel, Daniel Fišer, Jörg Hoffmann, Michael Katz, Alexander Koller",2025-08-19,"LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13876v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"

promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning

capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly

been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300v1,cs.AI

progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is hindered by a
scarcity of scalable evaluation data. This work introduces NL2Flow, a fully
automated pipeline for generating and evaluating workflow planning problems.
NL2Flow generates problems parametrically in a structured intermediate
representation, translating them into both natural language and formal PDDL. I
evaluate several open-source, instruct-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 2296
low-difficulty problems generated by NL2Flow. Results demonstrate that the
best-performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in
generating optimal plans (for solvable problems). Regression analysis shows
that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent
on both model and prompt design. Importantly, translating natural language
problems into a structured JSON representation prior to symbolic planning
significantly improved success rates, suggesting a benefit from neuro-symbolic
integration. These findings underscore the importance of understanding error
sources within LLM reasoning as systems scale to more complex tasks. As LLM
reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting
bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253v6,cs.AI

Relaxing Goals with LLMs for Feasible 3D Scene Planning,"Emanuele Musumeci, Michele Brienza, Francesco Argenziano, Abdel Hakim Drid, Vincenzo Suriani, Daniele Nardi, Domenico D. Bloisi",2025-06-18,"Embodied agents need to plan and act reliably in real and complex 3D
environments. Classical planning (e.g., PDDL) offers structure and guarantees,
but in practice it fails under noisy perception and incorrect predicate
grounding. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)-based planners
leverage commonsense reasoning, yet frequently propose actions that are
unfeasible or unsafe. Following recent works that combine the two approaches,
we introduce ContextMatters, a framework that fuses LLMs and classical planning
to perform hierarchical goal relaxation: the LLM helps ground symbols to the
scene and, when the target is unreachable, it proposes functionally equivalent
goals that progressively relax constraints, adapting the goal to the context of
the agent's environment. Operating on 3D Scene Graphs, this mechanism turns
many nominally unfeasible tasks into tractable plans and enables context-aware
partial achievement when full completion is not achievable. Our experimental
results show a +52.45% Success Rate improvement over state-of-the-art LLMs+PDDL

texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft

approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in

we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we

scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the
transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon
integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale
datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts
neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and

models' (LLMs') performance on reasoning benchmarks such as math and logic.
However, past work has largely assumed that tasks are well-defined. In the real
world, queries to LLMs are often underspecified, only solvable through
acquiring missing information. We formalize this as a constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case of this
formalism where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can
rigorously evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question
to ask and quantify axes of difficulty levels for each problem. We present
QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most
one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: Logical reasoning tasks with one
missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with initial states
that are partially-observed, (3) GSM-Q: Human-annotated grade school math
problems with one missing variable assignment, and (4) GSME-Q: a version of
GSM-Q where word problems are translated into equations by human annotators.
The LLM is tasked with selecting the correct clarification question(s) from a
list of options. While state-of-the-art models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, their
accuracy is only 40-50% on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis demonstrates that
the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems may not be sufficient
for success on our benchmark: models have difficulty identifying the right
question to ask, even when they can solve the fully specified version of the
problem. Furthermore, in the Planning-Q domain, LLMs tend not to hedge, even
when explicitly presented with the option to predict ``not sure.'' This
highlights the need for deeper investigation into models' information
acquisition capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22674v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG"

One line of research focuses on translating natural language descriptions of
planning tasks into structured planning languages, such as the planning domain
definition language (PDDL). While this approach is promising, accurately
measuring the quality of generated PDDL code continues to pose significant
challenges. First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning
validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner. This
method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code
that does not align with the natural language description of the task. Second,
existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the
planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the
challenge of the task. To bridge this gap, we introduce \benchmarkName, a
benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to generate PDDL code
from natural language descriptions of planning tasks. We begin by creating a
PDDL equivalence algorithm that rigorously evaluates the correctness of PDDL
code generated by language models by flexibly comparing it against a ground
truth PDDL. Then, we present a dataset of $132,037$ text-to-PDDL pairs across
13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. Finally, we evaluate
several API-access and open-weight language models that reveal this task's

$A^*$'s search dynamics are expressed as a token sequence outlining when task
states are added and removed into the search tree during symbolic planning.
Searchformer significantly outperforms baselines that predict the optimal plan

improve generalizability by combining such models with classical planning
algorithms to address their inherent limitations in reasoning capabilities.
However, these approaches face the challenge of dynamically capturing the
initial state of the task planning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose
AutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation with
a planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agent
on the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planning
domain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planning
with arbitrary objects. AutoGPT+P leverages this representation to derive and
execute a plan for a task specified by the user in natural language. In
addition to solving planning tasks under a closed-world assumption, AutoGPT+P
can also handle planning with incomplete information, e. g., tasks with missing
objects by exploring the scene, suggesting alternatives, or providing a partial
plan. The affordance-based scene representation combines object detection with
an automatically generated object-affordance-mapping using ChatGPT. The core
planning tool extends existing work by automatically correcting semantic and
syntactic errors. Our approach achieves a success rate of 98%, surpassing the
current 81% success rate of the current state-of-the-art LLM-based planning

(about actions) to complete long-horizon tasks. Most of them have been
developed for ""closed worlds"" while assuming the robot is provided with
complete world knowledge. However, the real world is generally open, and the
robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break
the planner's completeness. Could we leverage the recent advances on
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable classical planning systems
to deal with novel situations?
  This paper introduces a novel framework, called COWP, for open-world task
planning and situation handling. COWP dynamically augments the robot's action
knowledge, including the preconditions and effects of actions, with
task-oriented commonsense knowledge. COWP embraces the openness from LLMs, and
is grounded to specific domains via action knowledge. For systematic
evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 1,085 execution-time
situations. Each situation corresponds to a state instance wherein a robot is
potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines
from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. Additionally, we have
demonstrated COWP using a mobile manipulator. Supplementary materials are

high-quality programming code, and predict protein folding, showcasing their
versatility in solving various tasks beyond language-based problems. In this
paper, we aim to explore how LLMs can also be used for automated planning. To
do so, we seek to answer four key questions. Firstly, we want to understand the
extent to which LLMs can be used for plan generation. Secondly, we aim to
identify which pre-training data is most effective in facilitating plan

(LLMs) to planning problems. However, methods that use LLMs directly as
planners are currently impractical due to several factors, including limited
correctness of plans, strong reliance on feedback from interactions with
simulators or even the actual environment, and the inefficiency in utilizing
human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel alternative paradigm that
constructs an explicit world (domain) model in planning domain definition
language (PDDL) and then uses it to plan with sound domain-independent
planners. To address the fact that LLMs may not generate a fully functional
PDDL model initially, we employ LLMs as an interface between PDDL and sources
of corrective feedback, such as PDDL validators and humans. For users who lack
a background in PDDL, we show that LLMs can translate PDDL into natural
language and effectively encode corrective feedback back to the underlying
domain model. Our framework not only enjoys the correctness guarantee offered
by the external planners but also reduces human involvement by allowing users
to correct domain models at the beginning, rather than inspecting and
correcting (through interactive prompting) every generated plan as in previous
work. On two IPC domains and a Household domain that is more complicated than
commonly used benchmarks such as ALFWorld, we demonstrate that GPT-4 can be
leveraged to produce high-quality PDDL models for over 40 actions, and the
corrected PDDL models are then used to successfully solve 48 challenging
planning tasks. Resources, including the source code, are released at:

as planners: given a task, generate a plan. We investigate whether LLMs can
serve as generalized planners: given a domain and training tasks, generate a
program that efficiently produces plans for other tasks in the domain. In
particular, we consider PDDL domains and use GPT-4 to synthesize Python
programs. We also consider (1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) summarization, where the
LLM is prompted to summarize the domain and propose a strategy in words before
synthesizing the program; and (2) automated debugging, where the program is
validated with respect to the training tasks, and in case of errors, the LLM is
re-prompted with four types of feedback. We evaluate this approach in seven
PDDL domains and compare it to four ablations and four baselines. Overall, we
find that GPT-4 is a surprisingly powerful generalized planner. We also
conclude that automated debugging is very important, that CoT summarization has
non-uniform impact, that GPT-4 is far superior to GPT-3.5, and that just two
training tasks are often sufficient for strong generalization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11014v2,cs.AI

generalization abilities: state-of-the-art chatbots can provide plausible
answers to many common questions that arise in daily life. However, so far,
LLMs cannot reliably solve long-horizon planning problems. By contrast,
classical planners, once a problem is given in a formatted way, can use
efficient search algorithms to quickly identify correct, or even optimal,
plans. In an effort to get the best of both worlds, this paper introduces
LLM+P, the first framework that incorporates the strengths of classical
planners into LLMs. LLM+P takes in a natural language description of a planning
problem, then returns a correct (or optimal) plan for solving that problem in
natural language. LLM+P does so by first converting the language description
into a file written in the planning domain definition language (PDDL), then
leveraging classical planners to quickly find a solution, and then translating
the found solution back into natural language. Along with LLM+P, we define a
diverse set of different benchmark problems taken from common planning
scenarios. Via a comprehensive set of experiments on these benchmark problems,
we find that LLM+P is able to provide optimal solutions for most problems,
while LLMs fail to provide even feasible plans for most problems.\footnote{The

due to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures.
However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in
real-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance
in complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present
a framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic
task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large
Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner
compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then
leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations
inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better
scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs'
response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the
output, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of
end-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is
generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn
enables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have
been devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities
of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an
overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific
planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead
predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that
our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000
samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic
planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by

plans in an open-world environment (e.g., Minecraft) necessitates accurate and
multi-step reasoning due to the long-term nature of tasks, and 2) as vanilla
planners do not consider how easy the current agent can achieve a given
sub-task when ordering parallel sub-goals within a complicated plan, the
resulting plan could be inefficient or even infeasible. To this end, we propose
""$\underline{D}$escribe, $\underline{E}$xplain, $\underline{P}$lan and

the plan execution process and providing self-$\textit{explanation}$ of
feedback when encountering failures during the extended planning phases.
Furthermore, it includes a goal $\textit{selector}$, which is a trainable
module that ranks parallel candidate sub-goals based on the estimated steps of
completion, consequently refining the initial plan. Our experiments mark the
milestone of the first zero-shot multi-task agent that can robustly accomplish
70+ Minecraft tasks and nearly double the overall performances. Further testing

socio-communicative skills. Classic approaches to program HRI from observed
human-human interactions fails to capture the subtlety of multimodal
interactions as well as the key structural differences between robots and
humans. The former arises due to a difficulty in quantifying and coding
multimodal behaviours, while the latter due to a difference of the degrees of
liberty between a robot and a human. However, the notion of reverse engineering
from multimodal HRI traces to learn the underlying behavioral blueprint of the
robot given multimodal traces seems an option worth exploring. With this
spirit, the entire HRI can be seen as a sequence of exchanges of speech acts
between the robot and human, each act treated as an action, bearing in mind
that the entire sequence is goal-driven. Thus, this entire interaction can be
treated as a sequence of actions propelling the interaction from its initial to
goal state, also known as a plan in the domain of AI planning. In the same
domain, this action sequence that stems from plan execution can be represented
as a trace. AI techniques, such as machine learning, can be used to learn
behavioral models (also known as symbolic action models in AI), intended to be
reusable for AI planning, from the aforementioned multimodal traces. This
