Using Large Language Models for Abstraction of Planning Domains - Extended Version,"Bita Banihashemi, Megh Patel, Yves Lespérance",2025-10-23,"Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on. We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these. The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the associated fluents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20258v1,"cs.AI, I.2"
ParaCook: On Time-Efficient Planning for Multi-Agent Systems,"Shiqi Zhang, Xinbei Ma, Yunqing Xu, Zouying Cao, Pengrui Lu, Haobo Yuan, Tiancheng Shen, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao, Ming-Hsuan Yang",2025-10-13,"Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game, ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity, establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware multi-agent planning.

A Systematic Study of Large Language Models for Task and Motion Planning With PDDLStream,Jorge Mendez-Mendez,2025-09-30,"Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16 algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower) reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to correct its mistakes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00182v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI"
Reasoning Core: A Scalable RL Environment for LLM Symbolic Reasoning,"Valentin Lacombe, Valentin Quesnel, Damien Sileo",2025-09-22,"We introduce Reasoning Core, a new scalable environment for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), designed to advance foundational symbolic reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18083v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
Toward PDDL Planning Copilot,"Yarin Benyamin, Argaman Mordoch, Shahaf S. Shperberg, Roni Stern",2025-09-16,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12987v1,cs.AI
Teaching LLMs to Plan: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction Tuning for Symbolic Planning,"Pulkit Verma, Ngoc La, Anthony Favier, Swaroop Mishra, Julie A. Shah",2025-09-14,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13351v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning For Continual Embodied Instruction Following,"Minjong Yoo, Jinwoo Jang, Wei-jin Park, Honguk Woo",2025-09-10,"This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP) framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously, we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process. Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal success rate and execution efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08222v1,cs.AI
Improved Generalized Planning with LLMs through Strategy Refinement and Reflection,"Katharina Stein, Nils Hodel, Daniel Fišer, Jörg Hoffmann, Michael Katz, Alexander Koller",2025-08-19,"LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on 17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains, our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generator.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13876v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
Intrinsic Memory Agents: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent LLM Systems through Structured Contextual Memory,"Sizhe Yuen, Francisco Gomez Medina, Ting Su, Yali Du, Adam J. Sobey",2025-08-12,"Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08997v1,cs.AI
How Far Are LLMs from Symbolic Planners? An NLP-Based Perspective,"Ma'ayan Armony, Albert Meroño-Peñuela, Gerard Canal",2025-08-02,"The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing (NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner. This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300v1,cs.AI
Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation,Jungkoo Kang,2025-07-03,"Robust workflow composition is critical for effective agent performance, yet progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is hindered by a scarcity of scalable evaluation data. This work introduces NL2Flow, a fully automated pipeline for generating and evaluating workflow planning problems. NL2Flow generates problems parametrically in a structured intermediate representation, translating them into both natural language and formal PDDL. I evaluate several open-source, instruct-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems generated by NL2Flow. Results demonstrate that the best-performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans (for solvable problems). Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. Importantly, translating natural language problems into a structured JSON representation prior to symbolic planning significantly improved success rates, suggesting a benefit from neuro-symbolic integration. These findings underscore the importance of understanding error sources within LLM reasoning as systems scale to more complex tasks. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253v6,cs.AI
Context Matters! Relaxing Goals with LLMs for Feasible 3D Scene Planning,"Emanuele Musumeci, Michele Brienza, Francesco Argenziano, Abdel Hakim Drid, Vincenzo Suriani, Daniele Nardi, Domenico D. Bloisi",2025-06-18,"Embodied agents need to plan and act reliably in real and complex 3D environments. Classical planning (e.g., PDDL) offers structure and guarantees, but in practice it fails under noisy perception and incorrect predicate grounding. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)-based planners leverage commonsense reasoning, yet frequently propose actions that are unfeasible or unsafe. Following recent works that combine the two approaches, we introduce ContextMatters, a framework that fuses LLMs and classical planning to perform hierarchical goal relaxation: the LLM helps ground symbols to the scene and, when the target is unreachable, it proposes functionally equivalent goals that progressively relax constraints, adapting the goal to the context of the agent's environment. Operating on 3D Scene Graphs, this mechanism turns many nominally unfeasible tasks into tractable plans and enables context-aware partial achievement when full completion is not achievable. Our experimental results show a +52.45% Success Rate improvement over state-of-the-art LLMs+PDDL baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we validate the execution of ContextMatter in a real world scenario by deploying it on a TIAGo robot.

Enhance Multimodal Consistency and Coherence for Text-Image Plan Generation,"Xiaoxin Lu, Ranran Haoran Zhang, Yusen Zhang, Rui Zhang",2025-06-13,"People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines.

GenPlanX. Generation of Plans and Execution,"Daniel Borrajo, Giuseppe Canonaco, Tomás de la Rosa, Alfredo Garrachón, Sriram Gopalakrishnan, Simerjot Kaur, Marianela Morales, Sunandita Patra, Alberto Pozanco, Keshav Ramani, Charese Smiley, Pietro Totis, Manuela Veloso",2025-06-12,"Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when provided using natural language.

This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI planning engine, alongside an execution and monitoring framework.

"Subtle Risks, Critical Failures: A Framework for Diagnosing Physical Safety of LLMs for Embodied Decision Making","Yejin Son, Minseo Kim, Sungwoong Kim, Seungju Han, Jian Kim, Dongju Jang, Youngjae Yu, Chanyoung Park",2025-05-26,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision making in embodied agents, yet existing safety evaluations often rely on coarse success rates and domain-specific setups, making it difficult to diagnose why and where these models fail. This obscures our understanding of embodied safety and limits the selective deployment of LLMs in high-risk physical environments. We introduce SAFEL, the framework for systematically evaluating the physical safety of LLMs in embodied decision making. SAFEL assesses two key competencies: (1) rejecting unsafe commands via the Command Refusal Test, and (2) generating safe and executable plans via the Plan Safety Test. Critically, the latter is decomposed into functional modules, goal interpretation, transition modeling, action sequencing, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of safety failures. To support this framework, we introduce EMBODYGUARD, a PDDL-grounded benchmark containing 942 LLM-generated scenarios covering both overtly malicious and contextually hazardous instructions. Evaluation across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that while models often reject clearly unsafe commands, they struggle to anticipate and mitigate subtle, situational risks. Our results highlight critical limitations in current LLMs and provide a foundation for more targeted, modular improvements in safe embodied reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19933v1,cs.AI
TCP: a Benchmark for Temporal Constraint-Based Planning,"Zifeng Ding, Sikuan Yan, Zhangdie Yuan, Xianglong Hu, Fangru Lin, Andreas Vlachos",2025-05-26,"Temporal reasoning and planning are essential capabilities for large language models (LLMs), yet most existing benchmarks evaluate them in isolation and under limited forms of complexity. To address this gap, we introduce the Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark that jointly assesses both capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we generate abstract problem prototypes that are then paired with realistic scenarios from various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models may struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire future research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19927v2,cs.AI
ViPlan: A Benchmark for Visual Planning with Symbolic Predicates and Vision-Language Models,"Matteo Merler, Nicola Dainese, Minttu Alakuijala, Giovanni Bonetta, Pietro Ferrazzi, Yu Tian, Bernardo Magnini, Pekka Marttinen",2025-05-19,"Integrating Large Language Models with symbolic planners is a promising direction for obtaining verifiable and grounded plans compared to planning in natural language, with recent works extending this idea to visual domains using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, rigorous comparison between VLM-grounded symbolic approaches and methods that plan directly with a VLM has been hindered by a lack of common environments, evaluation protocols and model coverage. We introduce ViPlan, the first open-source benchmark for Visual Planning with symbolic predicates and VLMs. ViPlan features a series of increasingly challenging tasks in two domains: a visual variant of the classic Blocksworld planning problem and a simulated household robotics environment. We benchmark nine open-source VLM families across multiple sizes, along with selected closed models, evaluating both VLM-grounded symbolic planning and using the models directly to propose actions. We find symbolic planning to outperform direct VLM planning in Blocksworld, where accurate image grounding is crucial, whereas the opposite is true in the household robotics tasks, where commonsense knowledge and the ability to recover from errors are beneficial. Finally, we show that across most models and methods, there is no significant benefit to using Chain-of-Thought prompting, suggesting that current VLMs still struggle with visual reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13180v1,cs.AI
Zero-Shot Iterative Formalization and Planning in Partially Observable Environments,"Liancheng Gong, Wang Zhu, Jesse Thomason, Li Zhang",2025-05-19,"Using LLMs not to predict plans but to formalize an environment into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) has been shown to improve performance and control. Existing work focuses on fully observable environments; we tackle the more realistic and challenging partially observable environments that lack of complete, reliable information. We propose PDDLego+, a framework to iteratively formalize, plan, grow, and refine PDDL representations in a zero-shot manner, without needing access to any existing trajectories. On two textual simulated environments, we show that PDDLego+ improves goal reaching success and exhibits robustness against problem complexity. We also show that the domain knowledge captured after a successful trial can benefit future tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13126v2,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
Achieving Scalable Robot Autonomy via neurosymbolic planning using lightweight local LLM,"Nicholas Attolino, Alessio Capitanelli, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni",2025-05-13,"PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability, re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration. Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08492v2,"cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO, I.2.6; I.2.8; I.2.9"
Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models with Refined Prompting for Online Task and Motion Planning,"Huihui Guo, Huilong Pi, Yunchuan Qin, Zhuo Tang, Kenli Li",2025-04-30,"With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing demand for intelligent robots capable of assisting humans in daily tasks and performing complex operations. Such robots not only require task planning capabilities but must also execute tasks with stability and robustness. In this paper, we present a closed-loop task planning and acting system, LLM-PAS, which is assisted by a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). While LLM-PAS plans long-horizon tasks in a manner similar to traditional task and motion planners, it also emphasizes the execution phase of the task. By transferring part of the constraint-checking process from the planning phase to the execution phase, LLM-PAS enables exploration of the constraint space and delivers more accurate feedback on environmental anomalies during execution. The reasoning capabilities of the LLM allow it to handle anomalies that cannot be addressed by the robust executor. To further enhance the system's ability to assist the planner during replanning, we propose the First Look Prompting (FLP) method, which induces LLM to generate effective PDDL goals. Through comparative prompting experiments and systematic experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of LLM-PAS in handling anomalous conditions during task execution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21596v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI"
Generating Structured Plan Representation of Procedures with LLMs,"Deepeka Garg, Sihan Zeng, Sumitra Ganesh, Leo Ardon",2025-03-28,"In this paper, we address the challenges of managing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which often suffer from inconsistencies in language, format, and execution, leading to operational inefficiencies. Traditional process modeling demands significant manual effort, domain expertise, and familiarity with complex languages like Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), creating barriers for non-techincal users. We introduce SOP Structuring (SOPStruct), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform SOPs into decision-tree-based structured representations. SOPStruct produces a standardized representation of SOPs across different domains, reduces cognitive load, and improves user comprehension by effectively capturing task dependencies and ensuring sequential integrity. Our approach enables leveraging the structured information to automate workflows as well as empower the human users. By organizing procedures into logical graphs, SOPStruct facilitates backtracking and error correction, offering a scalable solution for process optimization. We employ a novel evaluation framework, combining deterministic methods with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) to verify graph soundness, and non-deterministic assessment by an LLM to ensure completeness. We empirically validate the robustness of our LLM-based structured SOP representation methodology across SOPs from different domains and varying levels of complexity. Despite the current lack of automation readiness in many organizations, our research highlights the transformative potential of LLMs to streamline process modeling, paving the way for future advancements in automated procedure optimization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00029v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI"
QuestBench: Can LLMs ask the right question to acquire information in reasoning tasks?,"Belinda Z. Li, Been Kim, Zi Wang",2025-03-28,"Recently, a large amount of work has focused on improving large language models' (LLMs') performance on reasoning benchmarks such as math and logic. However, past work has largely assumed that tasks are well-defined. In the real world, queries to LLMs are often underspecified, only solvable through acquiring missing information. We formalize this as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case of this formalism where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can rigorously evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask and quantify axes of difficulty levels for each problem. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: Logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with initial states that are partially-observed, (3) GSM-Q: Human-annotated grade school math problems with one missing variable assignment, and (4) GSME-Q: a version of GSM-Q where word problems are translated into equations by human annotators. The LLM is tasked with selecting the correct clarification question(s) from a list of options. While state-of-the-art models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, their accuracy is only 40-50% on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis demonstrates that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems may not be sufficient for success on our benchmark: models have difficulty identifying the right question to ask, even when they can solve the fully specified version of the problem. Furthermore, in the Planning-Q domain, LLMs tend not to hedge, even when explicitly presented with the option to predict ``not sure.'' This highlights the need for deeper investigation into models' information acquisition capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22674v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG"

This paper aims to provide a timely survey of the current research with an in-depth analysis, positioning LLMs as tools for extracting and refining planning models to support reliable AP planners.

LLM+MAP: Bimanual Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models and Planning Domain Definition Language,"Kun Chu, Xufeng Zhao, Cornelius Weber, Stefan Wermter",2025-03-21,"Bimanual robotic manipulation provides significant versatility, but also presents an inherent challenge due to the complexity involved in the spatial and temporal coordination between two hands. Existing works predominantly focus on attaining human-level manipulation skills for robotic hands, yet little attention has been paid to task planning on long-horizon timescales. With their outstanding in-context learning and zero-shot generation abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied and grounded in diverse robotic embodiments to facilitate task planning. However, LLMs still suffer from errors in long-horizon reasoning and from hallucinations in complex robotic tasks, lacking a guarantee of logical correctness when generating the plan. Previous works, such as LLM+P, extended LLMs with symbolic planners. However, none have been successfully applied to bimanual robots. New challenges inevitably arise in bimanual manipulation, necessitating not only effective task decomposition but also efficient task allocation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLM+MAP, a bimanual planning framework that integrates LLM reasoning and multi-agent planning, automating effective and efficient bimanual task planning. We conduct simulated experiments on various long-horizon manipulation tasks of differing complexity. Our method is built using GPT-4o as the backend, and we compare its performance against plans generated directly by LLMs, including GPT-4o, V3 and also recent strong reasoning models o1 and R1.

SPIN-Bench: How Well Do LLMs Plan Strategically and Reason Socially?,"Jianzhu Yao, Kevin Wang, Ryan Hsieh, Haisu Zhou, Tianqing Zou, Zerui Cheng, Zhangyang Wang, Pramod Viswanath",2025-03-16,"Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.

Visualizing Thought: Conceptual Diagrams Enable Robust Planning in LMMs,"Nasim Borazjanizadeh, Roei Herzig, Eduard Oks, Trevor Darrell, Rogerio Feris, Leonid Karlinsky",2025-03-14,"Human reasoning relies on constructing and manipulating mental models -- simplified internal representations of situations used to understand and solve problems. Conceptual diagrams (e.g., a sketch drawn to aid reasoning) externalize these mental models, abstracting irrelevant details to efficiently capture how entities interact. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) predominantly reason through text, limiting their effectiveness on complex multi-step tasks. In this paper, we propose Visual Thinking, a generalizable framework that enables LMMs to reason through multiple chains of self-generated conceptual diagrams, significantly enhancing their combinatorial planning capabilities. Our approach requires no human input beyond the natural language description of the task. It integrates textual and diagrammatic reasoning within an optimized Graph-of-Thought inference framework, enhanced by beam search and depth-wise backtracking. Evaluated on multiple challenging PDDL planning domains, our method substantially improves LMM performance (e.g., GPT-4o: 35.5% -> 90.2% in Blocksworld) and consistently outperforms text-only search-based inference methods. On more difficult domains with solution depths up to 40, it also surpasses the o1-preview reasoning model (e.g., 16 percentage points improvement in Floor Tiles). These results demonstrate the power of conceptual diagrams as a reasoning medium in LMMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11790v3,cs.AI
Instruction-Augmented Long-Horizon Planning: Embedding Grounding Mechanisms in Embodied Mobile Manipulation,"Fangyuan Wang, Shipeng Lyu, Peng Zhou, Anqing Duan, Guodong Guo, David Navarro-Alarcon",2025-03-11,"Enabling humanoid robots to perform long-horizon mobile manipulation planning in real-world environments based on embodied perception and comprehension abilities has been a longstanding challenge. With the recent rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been a notable increase in the development of LLM-based planners. These approaches either utilize human-provided textual representations of the real world or heavily depend on prompt engineering to extract such representations, lacking the capability to quantitatively understand the environment, such as determining the feasibility of manipulating objects. To address these limitations, we present the Instruction-Augmented Long-Horizon Planning (IALP) system, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate feasible and optimal actions based on real-time sensor feedback, including grounded knowledge of the environment, in a closed-loop interaction. Distinct from prior works, our approach augments user instructions into PDDL problems by leveraging both the abstract reasoning capabilities of LLMs and grounding mechanisms. By conducting various real-world long-horizon tasks, each consisting of seven distinct manipulatory skills, our results demonstrate that the IALP system can efficiently solve these tasks with an average success rate exceeding 80%. Our proposed method can operate as a high-level planner, equipping robots with substantial autonomy in unstructured environments through the utilization of multi-modal sensor inputs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08084v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI"

Plan-over-Graph: Towards Parallelable LLM Agent Schedule,"Shiqi Zhang, Xinbei Ma, Zouying Cao, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao",2025-02-20,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in reasoning for task planning. However, challenges remain under-explored for parallel schedules. This paper introduces a novel paradigm, plan-over-graph, in which the model first decomposes a real-life textual task into executable subtasks and constructs an abstract task graph. The model then understands this task graph as input and generates a plan for parallel execution. To enhance the planning capability of complex, scalable graphs, we design an automated and controllable pipeline to generate synthetic graphs and propose a two-stage training scheme.

Scaling Autonomous Agents via Automatic Reward Modeling And Planning,"Zhenfang Chen, Delin Chen, Rui Sun, Wenjun Liu, Chuang Gan",2025-02-17,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of text-generation tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with problems requiring multi-step decision-making and environmental feedback, such as online shopping, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Unlike pure text data, collecting large-scale decision-making data is challenging. Moreover, many powerful LLMs are only accessible through APIs, which hinders their fine-tuning for agent tasks due to cost and complexity. To address LLM agents' limitations, we propose a framework that can automatically learn a reward model from the environment without human annotations. This model can be used to evaluate the action trajectories of LLM agents and provide heuristics for task planning. Specifically, our approach involves employing one LLM-based agent to navigate an environment randomly, generating diverse action trajectories. Subsequently, a separate LLM is leveraged to assign a task intent and synthesize a negative response alongside the correct response for each trajectory. These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative response) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable of scoring action trajectories. The effectiveness and generalizability of our framework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent benchmarks. In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant advancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities. By automating the learning of reward models, we overcome the challenges of data scarcity and API limitations, potentially revolutionizing the application of LLMs in complex and interactive environments.

Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models,"Zhouliang Yu, Yuhuan Yuan, Tim Z. Xiao, Fuxiang Frank Xia, Jie Fu, Ge Zhang, Ge Lin, Weiyang Liu",2025-02-07,"Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04728v2,cs.AI

However, the advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to generate heuristics tailored to specific planning problems, potentially challenging the necessity of domain independence as a strict design principle. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to automatically derive planning heuristics from task descriptions represented as successor generators and goal tests written in general purpose programming language. We investigate the trade-offs between domain-specific LLM-generated heuristics and traditional domain-independent methods in terms of computational efficiency and explainability. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can create heuristics that achieve state-of-the-art performance on some standard IPC domains, as well as their ability to solve problems that lack an adequate Planning Domain Definition Language ({\sc pddl}) representation.

To this end, we present a taxonomy of integration methods, exploring how LLMs can be utilized within the HP life cycle. Additionally, we provide a benchmark with a standardized dataset for evaluating the performance of future LLM-based HP approaches, and present initial results for a state-of-the-art HP planner and LLM planner.

Query-Efficient Planning with Language Models,"Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Wayne Chen, Kushal Kedia, Sanjiban Choudhury",2024-12-09,"Planning in complex environments requires an agent to efficiently query a world model to find a feasible sequence of actions from start to goal. Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their rich prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities, can potentially help with planning by searching over promising states and adapting to feedback from the world. In this paper, we propose and study two fundamentally competing frameworks that leverage LLMs for query-efficient planning. The first uses LLMs as a heuristic within a search-based planner to select promising nodes to expand and propose promising actions. The second uses LLMs as a generative planner to propose an entire sequence of actions from start to goal, query a world model, and adapt based on feedback. We show that while both approaches improve upon comparable baselines, using an LLM as a generative planner results in significantly fewer interactions. Our key finding is that the LLM as a planner can more rapidly adapt its planning strategies based on immediate feedback than LLM as a heuristic. We present evaluations and ablations on Robotouille and PDDL planning benchmarks and discuss connections to existing theory on query-efficient planning algorithms.

PDDLFuse: A Tool for Generating Diverse Planning Domains,"Vedant Khandelwal, Amit Sheth, Forest Agostinelli",2024-11-29,"Various real-world challenges require planning algorithms that can adapt to a broad range of domains. Traditionally, the creation of planning domains has relied heavily on human implementation, which limits the scale and diversity of available domains. While recent advancements have leveraged generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) for domain creation, these efforts have predominantly focused on translating existing domains from natural language descriptions rather than generating novel ones. In contrast, the concept of domain randomization, which has been highly effective in reinforcement learning, enhances performance and generalizability by training on a diverse array of randomized new domains. Inspired by this success, our tool, PDDLFuse, aims to bridge this gap in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). PDDLFuse is designed to generate new, diverse planning domains that can be used to validate new planners or test foundational planning models. We have developed methods to adjust the domain generators parameters to modulate the difficulty of the domains it generates. This adaptability is crucial as existing domain-independent planners often struggle with more complex problems.

However, prior work fails to address the possibility of hallucinations from LLMs, which results in failures to execute the planned actions largely due to logical fallacies at high- or low-levels.

It not only limits scalability but also introduces a potential for biased interpretation, as a single expert's interpretation of ambiguous natural language descriptions might not align with the user's actual intent. To address this, we propose a novel approach that constructs an action schema library to generate multiple candidates, accounting for the diverse possible interpretations of natural language descriptions. We further introduce a semantic validation and ranking module that automatically filter and rank the generated schemas and plans without expert-in-the-loop. The experiments showed our pipeline maintains superiority in planning over the direct LLM planning approach.

RePrompt: Planning by Automatic Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models Agents,"Weizhe Chen, Sven Koenig, Bistra Dilkina",2024-06-17,"In the past year, large language models (LLMs) have had remarkable success in domains outside the traditional natural language processing, and their capacity is further expanded into the so-called LLM agents when connected with external tools. In all domains, the prompt to the LLMs has been shown to make a big difference in what the LLM would generate and thus affect the performance of the LLM agents. Therefore, automatic prompt engineering (APE) has become an important question for many researchers and users of LLMs. However, previous works in APE rely on a final checker to evaluate the performance of the given prompt -- a requirement that is hard to meet in the case of LLM agents, where intermediate feedback is easier to obtain, and the final evaluation could be expensive, inaccurate, or even missing. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \textsc{RePrompt}, which does a ``gradient descent""-like approach to optimize the step-by-step instructions in the prompts given to LLM agents, based on the chat history obtained from interactions and reflections with LLM agents. By leveraging intermediate feedback, \textsc{RePrompt} can optimize the prompt without the need for a final solution checker.

LLM+Reasoning+Planning for Supporting Incomplete User Queries in Presence of APIs,"Sudhir Agarwal, Anu Sreepathy, David H. Alonso, Prarit Lamba",2024-05-21,"Recent availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous LLM-based approaches aimed at providing natural language interfaces for various end-user tasks. These end-user tasks in turn can typically be accomplished by orchestrating a given set of APIs. In practice, natural language task requests (user queries) are often incomplete, i.e., they may not contain all the information required by the APIs. While LLMs excel at natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they frequently hallucinate on missing information or struggle with orchestrating the APIs. The key idea behind our proposed approach is to leverage logical reasoning and classical AI planning along with an LLM for accurately answering user queries including identification and gathering of any missing information in these queries. Our approach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a user query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) via an intermediate representation in ASP. We introduce a special API ""get_info_api"" for gathering missing information. We model all the APIs as PDDL actions in a way that supports dataflow between the APIs. Our approach then uses a classical AI planner to generate an orchestration of API calls (including calls to get_info_api) to answer the user query. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly outperforms a pure LLM based approach by achieving over 95% success rate in most cases on a dataset containing complete and incomplete single goal and multi-goal queries where the multi-goal queries may or may not require dataflow among the APIs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12433v3,cs.AI
NL2Plan: Robust LLM-Driven Planning from Minimal Text Descriptions,"Elliot Gestrin, Marco Kuhlmann, Jendrik Seipp",2024-05-07,"Classical planners are powerful systems, but modeling tasks in input formats such as PDDL is tedious and error-prone.

In an attempt to merge the best of these two approaches, some work has begun to use LLMs to automate parts of the PDDL creation process. However, these methods still require various degrees of expert input or domain-specific adaptations. We present NL2Plan, the first fully automatic system for generating complete PDDL tasks from minimal natural language descriptions. NL2Plan uses an LLM to incrementally extract the necessary information from the short text input before creating a complete PDDL description of both the domain and the problem which is finally solved by a classical planner. We evaluate NL2Plan on seven planning domains, five of which are novel and thus not in the LLM training data, and find that NL2Plan outperforms directly generating the files with an LLM+validator combination.

TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large Language Models,"David Bai, Ishika Singh, David Traum, Jesse Thomason",2024-03-25,"Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, such as concurrent actions between two agents when there are no conflicting conditions, without significant modification and definition to existing PDDL domains. A human expert aware of such constraints can decompose a goal into subgoals, each reachable through single agent planning, to take advantage of simultaneous actions. In contrast to classical planning, large language models (LLMs) directly used for inferring plan steps rarely guarantee execution success, but are capable of leveraging commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of both classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for multi-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone, as well as most multiagent plans, while guaranteeing execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals result in similar multi-agent execution lengths to those specified by human experts.

Here we automate this conversion step, showing how to leverage an LLM to automatically generate NL prompts from PDDL input. Our automatically generated NL prompts result in similar LLM-planning performance as the previous manually generated ones. Beyond this, the automation enables us to run much larger experiments, providing for the first time a broad evaluation of LLM planning performance in PDDL.
