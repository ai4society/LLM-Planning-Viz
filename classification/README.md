# Paper Classification

This folder contains scripts and data for classifying research papers into different categories. The goal is to automatically assign categories to papers based on their content, such as title and abstract.

## Directory Structure

The `classification` directory is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: This directory is intended to store the datasets used for training, validation, and testing of the classification models. It may contain raw data, preprocessed data, and feature-engineered data.

- **`multi_label/`**: This directory contains scripts and notebooks for multi-label classification tasks. In multi-label classification, a paper can be assigned to multiple categories simultaneously. This is common in scientific literature where a paper can span several research areas.

- **`single_label/`**: This directory is dedicated to single-label classification tasks. In this case, each paper is assigned to exactly one category from a predefined set of categories.

- **`outputs/`**: This directory is used to store the outputs generated by the classification models. This can include:
  - Trained model files (e.g., saved model weights and architectures).
  - Evaluation results (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
  - Predictions made by the models on test data.
  - Plots and visualizations of the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with the classification tasks, you should first place your dataset in the `data/` directory. Then, you can explore the scripts in the `single_label/` or `multi_label/` directories depending on your classification needs.
