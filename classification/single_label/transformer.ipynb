         "Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy\ndue to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures.\nHowever, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in\nreal-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance\nin complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present\na framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic\ntask planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner\ncompatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then\nleveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations\ninherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better\nscalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs'\nresponse time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the\noutput, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of\nend-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is\ngenerated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn\nenables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have\nbeen devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities\nof LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an\noverall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific\nplanning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead\npredictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that\nour method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000\nsamples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic\nplanner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by\nup to 61.4%",

         "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on a wide\nvariety of tasks, but they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step\nreasoning or goal-directed planning. To address this, we take inspiration from\nthe human brain, in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent\ninteraction of specialized modules in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These\nmodules perform functions such as conflict monitoring, state prediction, state\nevaluation, task decomposition, and task coordination. We find that LLMs are\nsometimes capable of carrying out these functions in isolation, but struggle to\nautonomously coordinate them in the service of a goal. Therefore, we propose a\nblack box architecture with multiple LLM-based (GPT-4) modules. The\narchitecture improves planning through the interaction of specialized\nPFC-inspired modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief\nautomated calls to the LLM. We evaluate the combined architecture on three\nchallenging planning tasks -- graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi, and logistics --\nfinding that it yields significant improvements over standard LLM methods\n(e.g., zero-shot prompting, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought). These\nresults demonstrate the benefit of utilizing knowledge from cognitive\nneuroscience to improve planning in LLMs.",

         "Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on. We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these. The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the associated fluents.",

         "Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16 algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower) reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to correct its mistakes.",
