# Visualization Tool for LLM-based Planning Literature

## Overview
The field of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Planning has expanded rapidly, with an 850% increase in research papers from 2022 to 2023, and continues to grow in 2024. This visualization tool was developed to centralize and categorize the exponentially growing literature on this topic. Originating from our paper presented at ICAPS 2024, *"[On the Prospects of Incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Planning and Scheduling (APS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02500)"*, our repository aims to update and refine the categorization of relevant research continually with the help of crowd-sourcing.

## Categories of LLM Use in Planning
Our work identifies eight distinct categories where LLMs are applied in the field of planning:

| Category               | Description                                                                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :globe_with_meridians: **Language Translation** | Translates natural language into structured planning languages (e.g., PDDL) and vice versa.           |
| :straight_ruler: **Plan Generation**      | Directly generates plans or strategies using LLMs.                                                    |
| :building_construction: **Model Construction**   | Uses LLMs to build or refine world and domain models for planning.                                    |
| :people_holding_hands: **Multi-agent Planning** | Enhances coordination and strategy among multiple agents.                                             |
| :repeat: **Interactive Planning** | Involves interactive, iterative planning processes with dynamic inputs.                               |
| :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Heuristics Optimization** | Improves planning efficiency by optimizing heuristics.                                                |
| :hammer_and_wrench: **Tool Integration**     | Integrates LLMs with other systems like planners and theorem provers.                                 |
| :brain: **Brain-Inspired Planning** | Develops LLM architectures inspired by cognitive processes to enhance planning capabilities.         |
